My Courses block - an alternative to the Course Overview block used on "My" Homepages.

This block allows the site admin to configure a list of course categories that appear as "tabs" on the left of the block.

each category can show the list of courses as a simple list with just the course name or in the same manner that the course overview block shows.
Each category/tab can be configured to show all courses or only enrolled courses and you can also elect to include all child categories in the list as well.

This block is quite wide so only works well on the 'My' homepage or with themes that allow blocks in a fullwidth column.
